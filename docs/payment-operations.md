# Payment reconciliation operations

Automatic reconciliation processes only `pending`, `processing`, and `unresolved` ZaloPay attempts within their reconciliation window. The scheduled `payments:query-pending` command deliberately excludes `review` payments.

`review` is an operator-controlled state. An authorized manager or administrator with `bookings.operate` may use **Admin → Payment review** to query the existing provider order. The POST action is authenticated, CSRF protected, rate limited, and audited. It never creates a provider order. Only authoritative success for the same payment identity and amount can use the shared verified transition, and that transition re-locks the booking, payment, and reserved seats.

Keep the payment in review when the provider remains uncertain, the amount or transaction identity differs, the booking has expired, or its seats were released or rebooked. These cases must not issue a ticket. Escalate late success and possible refund cases to the payment provider and finance team before changing any operational state.

Do not initiate a replacement payment while any attempt for the same booking and provider is `pending`, `processing`, `unresolved`, or `review`. Resolve the existing attempt and its refund exposure first.

Duplicate callbacks never repair ticket delivery. For a historical `success` payment whose booking is still fully paid but whose outbox row is missing, an active operator with `bookings.operate` must run `php artisan payments:recover-ticket-delivery PAYMENT_ID --actor=USER_ID`. The command locks and revalidates the payment and booking, creates only the missing pending delivery row, and logs the operator/payment/booking IDs. It never queries or creates a provider order.

## Production ticket email transport

MovieMate provisions `smtp` as the only production leaf transport by default. Set `MAIL_PRODUCTION_ALLOWED_TRANSPORTS=smtp`; add another Laravel delivery leaf only after its required package and delivery mechanism have been explicitly provisioned and its named mailer exists in `config/mail.php`. Values are comma-separated transport identities, not mailer names. Unknown/custom resolvers cannot be approved by this allow-list because their behavior cannot be inspected from configuration. `log`, `array`, `null`, `failover`, and `roundrobin` can never be allowed as leaves.

The application recursively validates the selected named mailer at production boot and again before the ticket outbox command queries or claims a row. A `failover` or `roundrobin` mailer is accepted only when every reachable branch ends at an approved leaf. Never configure a `log` or `array` fallback: besides not delivering a message, those transports can expose the guest ticket access fragment in process memory or logs.

After changing any mail environment value, rebuild the configuration cache and restart every web, scheduler, and queue/command worker process. In the deployed production environment, run `php artisan about` as the mail configuration health check. It performs no send and exits non-zero during application boot if the selected graph is missing, malformed, cyclic, too deep, or reaches an unapproved transport. Run the check again after rebuilding the config cache and before starting workers.

Ticket delivery is at-least-once. An approved SMTP send can succeed remotely even if the client later receives a transport error, so an operator must not assume exactly-once delivery. Real transport failures retain the outbox row with exponential backoff while the booking and payment remain paid and the ticket remains usable. The scheduled `bookings:send-pending-tickets` command retries due rows. If a historical paid booking has no outbox row, use the explicit `payments:recover-ticket-delivery` procedure above; duplicate payment callbacks are not a recovery mechanism.
